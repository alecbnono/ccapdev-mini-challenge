        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Alec, a CS student at De La Salle University with a passion for
          understanding how things work—both in hardware and software. Whether
          it’s exploring capabilities of algorithms, diving into operating
          system internals, or building modern web apps, I enjoy exploring the
          wonders of technology.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My interest in technology started as early as three years old. Growing
          up, I didn’t see it as a career path — just a tool to make life
          easier. As college applications approached in my final year of high
          school, I realized Engineering wasn’t the right fit for me and
          eventually fell down the Computer Science rabbit hole. Surprisingly,
          I’ve been enjoying every aspect of it ever since, from solving
          problems at the hardware level to building full-stack applications.

        <h2>Life outside Code</h2>
        <p>
          When I’m not buried in lines of code, you’ll probably find me in the
          kitchen, experimenting with recipes—sometimes nailing the perfect
          comfort dish, sometimes ending up with a “learning experience.” Music
          is always close by, especially hip-hop, which fuels my focus and keeps
          me in the zone.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m also a big fan of Filipino stand-up comedy, especially the sharp
          wit of Comedy Manila and the unfiltered humor of Koolpals. Beyond the
          laughs, I admire how comedians use humor as a bridge—breaking the ice,
          easing tension, and making strangers feel like friends. It’s inspired
          me to bring the same energy into how I connect with people: using
          humor to spark conversations, build rapport, and make interactions
          feel a little more human.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lately, I’ve also been exploring the world of fragrances—learning how
          different scents can capture moods, memories, and even stories.
          Whether it’s coding, cooking, comedy, or cologne, I love finding the
          little details that make an experience memorable.
